    "**Problem:** An array with n-elements is given. You need to find the index of element (target) that you need to search in the array. The array and the target can be provided as inputs to the Binary Search method, while the index of the target element should be returned as output. It should return -1, if no such element is found in the input array.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Think of running time as function of the size of its input. Since clearly, the running time increases with the size of input.\n",
    "2. We focus on how fast a function grows with the input size. This is called **rate of growth** of the algorithm's running time. We drop the less significant terms and coefficients from the running time equation, this gives us it's rate of growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we drop the constant coefficients and the less significant terms, we use asymptotic notation. We'll see three forms of it: big-Θ (Theta) notation, big-O notation, and big-Ω(Omega) notation.\n",

    "**Big-Θ Notation:** When we say that a particular running time is ***Θ(n)***, we are saying that once **n** gets large enough, the running time is at least *k<sub>1</sub> ⋅ n* and at most *k<sub>2</sub> ⋅ n* for some constants *k<sub>1</sub>* and *k<sub>2</sub>*. \n",

    "\n",
    "As long as these constants *k<sub>1</sub>* and *k<sub>2</sub>* exists, we say that the running time is ***Θ(n)***. The running time has upper bound as well as the lower bound.\n",

    "We are not restricted to just *n* in Big-Θ notation, we could have any function such as n<sup>2</sup>, nlog<sub>2</sub>n, or any other function of n. Here is how to think of a running time that is *Θ(f(n))* of some function *f(n)*.\n",
